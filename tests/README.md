Automated Testing of the Joomla CMS

Joomla maintains a range of different methods to run automated tests on its codebase.

Integration tests

The integration tests are checking the parts of PHP code of the Joomla CMS that interact with external services with the help of PHPUnit. For further information on the tests and on how to run them, please check out [tests/Integration/README.md](Integration/README.md).

Javascript tests
